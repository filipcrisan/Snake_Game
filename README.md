# Snake_Game
Using Swing toolkit

The game is implemented using JFrame and JPanel. I created this project mainly because I wanted to get acquainted to Java syntax, develop my OOP knowledge and experiment with different frameworks.

## Run
After you have a version of Java installed execute the following command:
```
java -jar ./out/artifacts/SnakeProject_jar/SnakeProject.jar
```
